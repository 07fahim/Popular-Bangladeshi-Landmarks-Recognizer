## Dataset Preparation

- **Data Collection:** Downloaded 500 images per class from DuckDuckGo.

_Notebooks available in_ `notebooks/data_prep.ipynb`.

---

## üßπ Data Cleaning

- **90/10 split** during cleaning.
- Used **FastAI‚Äôs `ImageClassifierCleaner`** to manually verify & fix mislabeled or irrelevant samples.
- Cleaning was done **once**, after which all models were trained on the **clean dataset**.

_Details in_ `notebooks/data_cleaning.ipynb`.

---

## Training & Models

- **80% train / 10% valid / 10% test** for final training and evaluation.
- Trained multiple popular CNN and Transformer models:

  - ResNet50
  - VGG19
  - EfficientNet-B0
  - DenseNet121

- **Fine-tuning:** 3 epochs per model with FastAI‚Äôs transfer learning.
- Used **validation set** for model selection.
- Saved each model as both `.pth` and `.pkl`.

_Training pipeline in_ `notebooks/training.ipynb`.

## Evaluation

- Final evaluation on **test set**:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report (precision, recall, F1-score)

_Comparison results in_ `notebooks/Test Evaluation.ipynb`.

### Observations

- **EfficientNet-B0**:

  - Lightweight and fast.
  - Achieved **96.3% accuracy**, but underperformed compared to heavier models.
  - Good baseline, ideal for deployment where inference speed is critical.

- **DenseNet121**:

  - Strong performance (**98.7% accuracy**).
  - Good balance between depth, accuracy, and efficiency.

- **VGG19_bn**:

  - Achieved the **highest validation accuracy (99.1%)**.
  - Slightly slower, but its deep layered architecture captured landmark features very well.
  - Chosen as the **final deployed model**.

- **ResNet50**:
  - Very competitive (**98.8% accuracy**) with low validation loss (0.0525).
  - Stable training and strong generalization.
  - Could also serve as a good deployment choice if performance vs. efficiency trade-off is considered.

---

### Best Model

- **VGG19_bn** was chosen for final deployment.
- Delivered the **highest validation accuracy (99.1%)** and **lowest error rate**.
- **test set accuracy ~99%**, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## üöÄ Deployment

- Exported best model as `.pkl`.
- Deployed the best model with **Gradio + HuggingFace Spaces**.
